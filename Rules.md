# The Bike Union Rules and Expectations

## Explanation of the Level System
#
    Everyone starts their employment at Level 1. 

    Checks are given out by managers when expectations aren’t met. 

    You move up a level when you complete a two week pay period with no more than 1 check. 

    If you receive two checks during a pay period you will drop down a level. 

    You must complete a two week pay period before you can move back up a level.

    There are certain offenses which will result in automatically being bumped down a level.

    In order to be eligible for Level 2 you must pass the Verbal Coffee !uiz.

    In order to be eligible for Level 3 you must pass the Practical Coffee Quiz.

## Rules and Expectations:


1. Phones are to be kept in the phone box while you are clocked in. In order to check your phone you need manager permission. Phones can be checked out for smoke breaks. Phones cannot be checked out for bathroom breaks. You will receive a check if you violate the phone expectations.

2. You are expected to be clocked in and ready to work at the start of your shift. 1 min late is late. If you are going to be late you are expected to call before your shift starts to let the manager know. Every tardy will result in a check.
  
3. You are expected to stay until the completion of your scheduled shift. If you do not stay until your shift is complete you will receive a check. At the end of the day, even if closing duties are completed, no one leaves before 4:15. 
  
4.  If you do not call in advance of your shift and miss an entire shift it will be considered a “no call no show”. A “no call no show” will result in being automatically bumped down to level 1.

5. Smoke breaks will be given at manager's discretion. Smoke breaks are taken one person at a timn

6. During 4 hour shifts you will have one paid 15 minute break. During shifts longer than 6 hours you will get one paid 30 minute break. You must return from break on time. 

7. If your attitude when you are in the building is not in alignment with good customer service or work ethic you will be given a verbal warning. If you do not adjust your attitude you will receive a check. 

8. Closing duties must be signed off on and completed. If you sign off on a closing duty and it is found to be incomplete, you will receive a check.

9. You are allowed one drink per 4 hour shift. You are allowed two drinks for any shift 8 hours or longer.
    
10. You must wear your staff t-shirt and closed toed shoes to every shift. You cannot wear pajama pants, slippers, skirts, or short shorts to work.
