Since Milestone 1, we have met with Ashley Carlson, who is the Program Manager for Bike Union and Coffee. During our meeting with Ashley, we got the information we needed to make the ERD which then used for the RM. The specific information we got included all the categories the Executives must have for all members, how the classes are taught, and how the grants function to help the Bike Union and Coffee. After our meeting on Tuesday, September 15th, we made the necessary changes to our ERD entities from the Gantt Chart and included them in our ERD to provide a better program. We have also made the relational model to showcase how all the information is going to flow throughout the database. Our group has continuously met on a weekly basis through zoom, and some in class, to discuss how to best make Milestone 2 gradually in order to produce the best results.</span></p><p></p>
